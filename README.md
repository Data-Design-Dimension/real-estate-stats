Under construction...

There is a long history of financial institutions as actors in the de jure segregation of United States history. Read this article for a short primer on that background: https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-federal-government-intentionally-racially-segregated-american-cities-180963494/

Having personally lived in a neighborhood which has welcomed its first bank after lacking one for over 30 years, during which time I gradually moved my accounts to online only banks, I've wondered what affect does a local brick and mortal establishment have today on home mortgage lending, if any, and is it any more equitable?
